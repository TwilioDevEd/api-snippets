Programmable Voice















Programmable Voice Quickstart for PHP
With just a few lines of code, your PHP web application can make and receive phone calls with Twilio Programmable Voice.

This PHP Voice quickstart will teach you to do this using Twilio's Voice REST API, the Twilio PHP helper library, the built-in PHP development web server, and ngrok to expose your local server to Twilio.

We'll use the Composer package manager for dependency management (don't want to? Try our Non Composer PHP Voice Quickstart).

In this quickstart, you will learn how to:

Sign up for Twilio and get your first voice-enabled Twilio phone number
Check and install any PHP prerequisites using Composer
Make an outbound phone call and play an MP3
Receive and respond to an inbound phone call to read a message to a caller using Text to Speech
